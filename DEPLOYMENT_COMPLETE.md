```

#### Common Issues:

**1. Build Timeout:**
- Reason: Large image upload (231 MB)
- Solution: Wait longer, or split images into smaller commits

**2. Memory Error:**
- Reason: Node.js out of memory during build
- Solution: Increase memory in Render settings

**3. Missing Dependencies:**
- Reason: package.json not updated
- Solution: Already handled (npm install in build)

**4. Image 404 Errors:**
- Reason: Images not in public folder
- Solution: Already fixed (all in public/coloring-images/)
