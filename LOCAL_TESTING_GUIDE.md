## üöÄ Step-by-Step Local Testing

### Step 1: Start Backend (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/backend
bash start-backend.sh
```

Wait until you see:
```
‚úÖ Backend started successfully!
üåê API: http://localhost:8080/api
```

### Step 2: Add Paintings to Local Database (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/tools
chmod +x add_paintings_local.sh
bash add_paintings_local.sh
```

This will add all 47 new paintings to your local backend.

### Step 3: Start Frontend (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend
npm run dev
```

Wait until you see:
```
  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

### Step 4: Test in Browser

Open: **http://localhost:3000**

#### Things to Check:

1. **Home Page** - Should show new paintings in the grid
2. **Categories**:
   - Click "Holidays" - should see 8 holiday paintings
   - Click "Animals" - should see 20 animal paintings
   - Click "Mandalas" - should see 6 mandala paintings
   - Click "Fantasy" - should see 6 fantasy paintings
   - Click "Sports" - should see 4 sports paintings

3. **Search** - Try searching:
   - "unicorn" - should find the magical unicorn
   - "fairy" - should find 3 fairy paintings
   - "mandala" - should find 6 mandalas
   - "taylor swift" - should find pop star singer

4. **Spanish** - Change language to Spanish (ES):
   - All new paintings should have Spanish titles
   - Descriptions should be in Spanish

5. **Individual Pages** - Click on a new painting:
   - Image should load (not broken)
   - Coloring tools should work
   - "More Pages" section should show related paintings

#### Quick Test URLs:
```
http://localhost:3000/painting/unicorn
http://localhost:3000/painting/fairy
http://localhost:3000/painting/santa-claus
http://localhost:3000/painting/bird-mandala
http://localhost:3000/painting/astronaut
http://localhost:3000/painting/taylor-swift

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start?
```bash
# Check if port 8080 is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>

# Try starting again
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/backend
bash start-backend.sh
```

### Images not loading?
- Check that images exist in: `/Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend/public/coloring-images/`
- Verify filenames match exactly (check underscores vs dashes)

### Paintings not showing?
- Make sure backend script completed successfully
- Check backend API directly: http://localhost:8080/api/paintings
- Look for paintings with recent `createdAt` timestamps

### Frontend errors?
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```
