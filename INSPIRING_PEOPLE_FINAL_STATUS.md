## ⚠️ ACTION NEEDED: Restart Railway Backend

**Why?** The backend has two cache layers that need clearing:

1. **Individual Painting Cache** (`@Cacheable` on paintings)
   - Currently serving paths without leading `/`
   - Causes images to not load on 18 of 19 pages
   
2. **Categories List Cache** (`@Cacheable` on categories)
   - Doesn't include "inspiring people" yet
   - Category won't show on home page until cleared

### How to Restart:

1. Go to: **https://railway.app/dashboard**
2. Find: **docker-composeyaml-production**
3. Click on your backend service
4. Click: **Redeploy** or **Restart**
5. Wait: 30-60 seconds

## ✨ After Restart - What Will Work:

### Home Page
✅ "⭐ Inspiring People" category card appears
✅ Click leads to `/category/inspiring_people`

### Category Page
✅ Shows all 19 inspiring people
✅ Each has image, title, description
✅ Filters and search work

### Individual Pages
✅ All 19 images load correctly:
- `/painting/leonardo-da-vinci` ✅
- `/painting/albert-einstein` ✅
- `/painting/florence-nightingale` ✅
- ... all 16 others ✅

### Spanish Version
✅ `/es/category/inspiring_people` 
✅ All content in Spanish
✅ All 19 pages work in Spanish

## 🎯 Summary:

**Everything is ready!** Just need to restart the Railway backend to:
1. Clear painting caches → images load

**One restart = everything works perfectly!** 🚀✨
