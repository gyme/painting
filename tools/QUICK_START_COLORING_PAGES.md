## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Issue: Image has gray shading

**Fix:** Use Photopea threshold adjustment (see above)

### Issue: Lines aren't closed / coloring leaks

**Fix:** 
- Use eraser tool to close small gaps manually
- Or regenerate with emphasis on "closed paths"

### Issue: Too much/little detail

**Fix:** Adjust prompt:
- Less detail: "simple coloring page for young children"
- More detail: "intricate coloring page for adults"

### Issue: AI adds color to the image

**Fix:** 
- Add "BLACK AND WHITE ONLY" in caps to prompt
- Regenerate until you get pure line art
- Convert to grayscale as post-processing step
