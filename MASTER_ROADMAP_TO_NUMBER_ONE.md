I run mycolor.fun, a free coloring pages website focused on 
child development and educational content.

We've created 1,000+ original coloring pages and comprehensive 
guides for parents and teachers.

Would you consider adding us to your resources page? Our visitors

back from our site.

Here's a suggested description:

focus and parent resources"

Thanks for your time!
Best,
[Your Name]
```
