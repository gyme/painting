## Why Google Showed "Couldn't Fetch"

The error happened because we were updating the sitemaps. Google's last crawl attempt was during the domain changes.

### Common Reasons for "Couldn't fetch":
1. ✅ **Timing** - We were deploying changes when Google tried (FIXED)
2. ✅ **Domain mismatch** - Fixed and reverted to correct domain
3. ✅ **XML validation** - All files pass validation
4. ✅ **Accessibility** - All files are publicly accessible
5. ⏳ **Cache** - Google may need time to re-crawl

## 🔧 Steps to Fix in Google Search Console

### 1. Remove Old Sitemap Entry (if exists)
- Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
- Click **Sitemaps**
- If you see an old/failed entry, click **⋮** → **Remove**

### 2. Submit Sitemap-Index (Recommended Method)
Just submit the index file - it points to the others:

```
sitemap-index.xml
```

Type just: `sitemap-index.xml` (no domain)

This index contains:
- sitemap.xml (220 pages: 86 paintings × 2 languages + static)
- image-sitemap.xml (86 images for Google Image Search)

### 3. Alternative: Submit All Three Separately
If you prefer to submit them individually:

```
sitemap-index.xml
sitemap.xml
image-sitemap.xml
```

## 🔄 Force Google to Re-Crawl

After submitting, you can manually request indexing for key pages:

1. In Google Search Console, go to **URL Inspection**
2. Enter: `https://www.mycolor.fun/`
3. Click **Request Indexing**
4. Repeat for a few key painting pages
