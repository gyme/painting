CHANGE MADE:
  Increased padding-bottom from 220px → 240px
  This gives more space for the bottom controls

LOCAL DEV SERVER:
  Status: Starting...
  URL: http://localhost:5173
  Test page: http://localhost:5173/painting/police-officer

HOW TO TEST:
  1. Open in Chrome DevTools (F12)
  2. Click device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M) 
  3. Select "iPhone 12 Pro" or similar
  4. Navigate to: /painting/police-officer
  5. Check if full image visible (head to feet)
  6. Check if bottom controls visible

WHAT TO CHECK:
  ✓ Full police officer visible (including feet)
  ✓ Color palette visible and scrollable
  ✓ All toolbar buttons visible (Fill, Brush, etc.)
  ✓ No cropping at top or bottom
  ✓ Nice spacing around image

IF STILL CROPPED:
  Let me know and I'll increase padding-bottom even more
  (Current: 240px, can go to 260px or 280px if needed)

ONLY AFTER IT WORKS LOCALLY:
  Then I'll deploy to production (vercel --prod)
