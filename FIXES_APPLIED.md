# Bug Fixes Applied - Coloring Pages & UI Crowding

## Issues Reported:
1. **Coloring pages don't work anymore**
2. **Website is too crowded**

---

## üîß **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Fixed Coloring Functionality** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Aggressive print CSS was interfering with the interactive canvas coloring functionality.

**Solution:**
- **File:** `frontend/src/index.css`
- **Changes:**
  - Removed overly aggressive `* { background: white !important; }` rule in print media query
  - Changed to target only specific elements: `body, header, footer, nav, div:not(.interactive-coloring):not(.coloring-area)`
  - This prevents the canvas coloring area from being affected by print styles
  - Reduced focus outline from 3px to 2px for less visual noise
  - Simplified focus states (removed redundant rules)

```css
/* Before (BROKEN): */
* {
  background: white !important;  /* This broke the canvas! */
}

/* After (FIXED): */
body, header, footer, nav, div:not(.interactive-coloring):not(.coloring-area) {
  background: white !important;  /* Canvas is excluded */
}
```

### **5. Simplified CategoryPage Filters** ‚úÖ
