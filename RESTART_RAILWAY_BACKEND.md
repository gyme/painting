# üîÑ Restart Railway Backend to Clear Cache

The taxi painting has been updated to **Vehicles** category, but the backend cache needs to be cleared.

## Manual Restart Steps:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/
2. Login to your account
3. Select the **docker-composeyaml-production** project
4. Click on the **backend** service
5. Click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) in the top right
6. Select **Restart**
7. Wait 30-60 seconds for the service to restart

## What Changed:

- **Taxi painting** (ID: 30)
  - **Before:** Category = "Animals" ‚ùå
  - **After:** Category = "Vehicles" ‚úÖ
  - Description updated to reference "vehicles" instead of "animals"
  - Tags updated to: `taxi,vehicles,transportation,city,car,coloring,kids`

## Verification:

After restarting, visit:
- https://www.mycolor.fun/painting/taxi 

The page should now show:
- Taxi appears in the **Vehicles** category
- Description: "A wonderful taxi coloring page for kids who love vehicles!"
- Spanish: "¬°Una hermosa p√°gina para colorear de taxi! Perfecta para ni√±os que aman los veh√≠culos."

**Note:** The update was successful in the database (confirmed by PUT response showing `updatedAt: 2025-10-18T17:51:34`), but the cached GET response needs a backend restart to reflect the change.
