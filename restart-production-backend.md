# ðŸ”„ Restart Production Backend to Show Italian Brainrot Category

## The Issue

The backend is **caching the old categories list**. The 8 Italian Brainrot paintings are in the database, but the backend's `@Cacheable` annotation is serving old data.

## âœ… Solution: Restart the Backend

You have 2 options:

### Option 1: Via Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your backend service (docker-compose.yaml)
3. Click the **"â‹®"** menu (three dots)
4. Click **"Restart"**
5. Wait ~30 seconds for it to restart

### Option 2: Via Railway CLI

```bash
cd backend
railway redeploy
# Press 'y' when prompted
```

---

## âœ… After Restart, Verify:

Check that the category appears:

```bash
curl https://docker-composeyaml-production.up.railway.app/api/paintings/categories
```

You should see **"Italian Brainrot"** in the list.

Then check your production site:
- https://painting-sand.vercel.app
- Look for "Italian Brainrot ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹" in the categories

## What's Already Done âœ…

- âœ… Frontend deployed with Italian flag icon ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
