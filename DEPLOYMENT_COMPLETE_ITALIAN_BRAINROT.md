## 🔄 Final Step: Backend Cache

The backend is currently **caching the old categories list**. 

**I've triggered a redeploy** in the background. It should be ready in 1-2 minutes.

### To Verify It's Working:

**Check the API:**
```bash
curl https://docker-composeyaml-production.up.railway.app/api/paintings/categories
```

You should see: `["Animals", "Characters", "Fantasy", "Italian Brainrot", "Nature", "Vehicles"]`

**Check the website:**
- Visit: https://painting-sand.vercel.app
- Scroll to "Browse by Category"
- Look for "Italian Brainrot 🇮🇹"

**If the category doesn't appear yet:**

Go to Railway Dashboard and restart manually:
1. Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your backend service
3. Click "⋮" (three dots) → "Restart"
4. Wait 30 seconds
