# ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Cache Restart Needed

## Issue
All 19 inspiring people have been updated in the database with correct image paths (starting with `/`), but the backend cache is still serving old data without the leading slash.

## Database Status  
‚úÖ **ALL FIXED** - Verified in database:
- `/coloring-images/leonardo_de_vinci.png`
- `/coloring-images/albert_einstein.png`
- `/coloring-images/florence_nighingale.png`
- And all 16 others...

## Current Problem
The backend uses `@Cacheable` on the `getPaintingByUrlKey` method, which means:
- ‚ùå GET requests return cached data (without `/`)
- ‚úÖ Database has correct data (with `/`)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Cache will eventually expire, but we need it now

## Solution: Restart Railway Backend

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your project: `docker-composeyaml-production`
3. Click on the backend service
4. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Redeploy** (or **Restart**)
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for restart

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# If Railway CLI supports it (commands vary by version)
railway redeploy --service backend
```

### Option 3: Wait for Cache Expiration
- The cache might have a TTL (time-to-live)
- It will eventually refresh with correct data
- But this could take minutes to hours

## What Will Happen After Restart
‚úÖ Cache cleared ‚Üí fresh data from database
‚úÖ All image paths will have leading `/`
‚úÖ Images will load correctly on all pages:
   - `/painting/leonardo-da-vinci` 
   - `/painting/florence-nightingale`
   - All 19 inspiring people

## Verification After Restart
Run this to verify cache is cleared:
```bash
curl -s "https://docker-composeyaml-production.up.railway.app/api/paintings/leonardo-da-vinci" | grep imageUrl
```

Should show: `"imageUrl":"/coloring-images/leonardo_de_vinci.png"`

**Status:** Ready to restart backend and make all images load! üöÄ
