# 🔔 IndexNow Setup Guide

IndexNow is now configured for your painting website! This guide explains how to use it to notify search engines instantly when your content changes.

---

## 🎯 What is IndexNow?

IndexNow is a protocol that allows you to notify search engines (Bing, Yandex, Seznam, and more) immediately when you add, update, or delete content on your website. This helps search engines discover your content faster without waiting for them to crawl your site.

### Benefits:
- ⚡ **Instant Indexing**: Search engines are notified within seconds
- 🌐 **Multiple Engines**: One submission reaches all participating search engines
- 💰 **Free**: No cost to use
- 🚀 **Better SEO**: Faster indexing = better search visibility

---

## ✅ What's Already Set Up

### 1. IndexNow Key File
Your key file is hosted at:
```
https://painting-sand.vercel.app/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt
```

**Important:** This file must remain in your `frontend/public/` directory. It proves you own the website.

**Your IndexNow Key:**
```
bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf
```

### 2. Submission Scripts
Two ready-to-use scripts have been created:

1. **`submit-to-indexnow.js`** - Submit single URLs
2. **`submit-bulk-to-indexnow.js`** - Submit multiple URLs at once (up to 10,000)

---

## 📝 How to Use

### Option 1: Submit a Single URL

Use this when you add or update a single painting, category, or page.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Submit homepage
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-sand.vercel.app/

# Submit a specific painting
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-sand.vercel.app/painting/unicorn

# Submit a category page
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-sand.vercel.app/category/animals

# Submit Spanish version
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-sand.vercel.app/es/painting/unicorn
```

**Output:**
```

## 🔄 When to Submit URLs

### Automatic Submission (Recommended)

You should submit to IndexNow whenever you:

1. ✅ **Add new paintings** → Submit the new painting URL
2. 📝 **Update painting details** → Submit the updated painting URL
3. 🗑️ **Delete a painting** → Submit the deleted URL
4. 🆕 **Add new categories** → Submit the category URL
5. 📄 **Update static pages** → Submit the page URL

### Manual Submission

You can also run bulk submissions:
- After deploying major updates
- Once a week to ensure all content is indexed
- After adding multiple paintings at once

---

## 🚀 Automate IndexNow Submissions

### For New Paintings

When you add paintings via your admin tool or scripts, add IndexNow submission:

**Example (in your painting upload script):**
```javascript
// After successfully adding a painting
const paintingUrl = `https://painting-sand.vercel.app/painting/${urlKey}`;
const spanishUrl = `https://painting-sand.vercel.app/es/painting/${urlKey}`;

// Submit to IndexNow
await exec(`node submit-to-indexnow.js ${paintingUrl}`);
await exec(`node submit-to-indexnow.js ${spanishUrl}`);
```

### Daily Bulk Submission (Optional)

Set up a cron job or scheduled task to submit all URLs daily:

**On macOS/Linux (crontab):**
```bash
# Run every day at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting && node submit-bulk-to-indexnow.js >> indexnow.log 2>&1
```

**On Windows (Task Scheduler):**
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Trigger: Daily at 2:00 AM
4. Action: Start a program
   - Program: `node`
   - Arguments: `submit-bulk-to-indexnow.js`
   - Start in: `C:\path\to\paiting`

---

## 🛠️ Integration with Deployment

### Deploy and Submit

After deploying new content, automatically submit URLs:

**Add to your deployment script (`deploy-all.sh`):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Deploy frontend
cd frontend
vercel --prod
cd ..

# Deploy backend
cd backend
railway up
cd ..

# Submit all URLs to IndexNow
echo "📤 Submitting URLs to IndexNow..."
node submit-bulk-to-indexnow.js

echo "✅ Deployment and IndexNow submission complete!"
```

---

## 🔍 Verify IndexNow is Working

### Check Key File
Your key file should be accessible at:
```
https://painting-sand.vercel.app/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt
```

**Test it:**
```bash
curl https://painting-sand.vercel.app/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt
```

Should return:
```
bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf
```

### Test Submission
```bash
# Test with homepage
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-sand.vercel.app/
```

**Expected responses:**
- ✅ **HTTP 200**: Success! URL submitted
- ⏳ **HTTP 202**: Accepted, validation pending
- ⚠️ **HTTP 400**: Bad request (check URL format)
- ⚠️ **HTTP 403**: Key validation failed (check key file)
- ⚠️ **HTTP 429**: Too many requests (slow down)

- Don't share your IndexNow key publicly
- Don't delete the key file from your public directory
- Don't submit more than 10,000 URLs per request

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: HTTP 403 (Forbidden)
**Cause:** Key file not found or key doesn't match

**Solution:**
1. Verify key file exists at: `frontend/public/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt`
2. Deploy to production (Vercel)
3. Test: `curl https://painting-sand.vercel.app/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt`

### Problem: HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
**Cause:** Submitting too frequently

**Solution:**
- Wait a few hours before submitting again
- Don't submit the same URL multiple times in a short period
- Use bulk submission instead of individual submissions

### Problem: Script not found
**Cause:** Running from wrong directory

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-sand.vercel.app/
```
