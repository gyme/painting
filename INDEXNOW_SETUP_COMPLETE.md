IndexNow is a protocol that notifies search engines **instantly** when your content changes. Instead of waiting for Bing to crawl your site (which can take days), IndexNow tells them immediately.

### Benefits You Get:
- ⚡ **Instant notification** to Bing, Yandex, and other search engines
- 🎨 **New logo indexed faster** - Your branding update will appear in search quickly
- 📘 **Facebook link indexed** - Social signals detected faster
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** - Any future changes can be submitted instantly

## 🔑 Your IndexNow Key

**Key File:** `bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt`

**Location:** 
- Local: `/frontend/public/`
- Production: https://painting-ipif8xuls-guym99-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt

✅ **Status:** Verified and working

## 📤 How to Use IndexNow

### Submit a Single URL (When you make changes)
```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-ipif8xuls-guym99-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/painting/new-image
```

### Submit All URLs (After major updates)
```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting
node submit-bulk-to-indexnow.js all
```

### Common Use Cases:
1. **New painting added** → Submit the painting URL
2. **Logo updated** → Submit homepage (✅ just did this!)
3. **Content changed** → Submit the changed page
4. **New category** → Submit category URL

## 🌐 Search Engines Notified

When you submit to IndexNow, these search engines are automatically notified:
- ✅ **Bing** (Microsoft)
- ✅ **Yandex** (Russia)
- ✅ **Seznam** (Czech Republic)
- ✅ **Other IndexNow partners**

**Note:** Google does NOT use IndexNow. For Google, continue using Google Search Console.

## ⏰ Timeline

**What to expect:**
- **Immediately:** Bing receives notification (✅ Done!)
- **1-24 hours:** Bing validates and starts indexing
- **2-7 days:** New content appears in Bing search results
- **Ongoing:** Future submissions take effect faster

## 📊 Verify IndexNow is Working

### 1. Check Key File (Should work now)
```bash
curl https://painting-ipif8xuls-guym99-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/bab9e73ed6fabc4a3ecdd32e9282a615bde47290f24070a8a9cecdbe74e86ddf.txt
```

Expected: Returns your IndexNow key

### 2. Check Bing Webmaster Tools
1. Go to: https://www.bing.com/webmasters

4. You should see submission statistics

### 3. Test a Submission
```bash
node submit-to-indexnow.js https://painting-ipif8xuls-guym99-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/contact
```

Expected: HTTP 200 or HTTP 202 (Success!)
