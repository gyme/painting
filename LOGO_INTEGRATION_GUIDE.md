   - Added LogoImage styled component with responsive sizing
   - Desktop: 60px height
   - Tablet: 45px height  
   - Mobile: 40px height
   - Drop shadow for visual depth
   - Smooth hover animation (1.05x scale)

   - Desktop: 80px height
   - Mobile: 60px height
   - Subtle drop shadow

## 📝 Next Steps

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
Save the circular rainbow logo image you provided as:
```
/Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend/public/logo.png
```

**Quick method:**
```bash
# If you have the logo in your current directory as logo.png:
cp logo.png /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend/public/logo.png

# Or use the helper script:
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting
./save-logo.sh
```

**💡 Tip:** Your logo is perfect for this coloring website! The rainbow colors and friendly pencil character match the playful, creative theme beautifully.

### Step 2: Test in Development
```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and check:
- ✓ Logo appears in the header
- ✓ Logo is properly sized on desktop
- ✓ Logo scales nicely on mobile devices
- ✓ Logo has smooth hover effect
- ✓ Logo links to home page

### Step 3: Verify Responsive Design
Test the logo on different screen sizes:
- **Desktop** (>1200px): Logo should be 60px height
- **Tablet** (768px-1200px): Logo should be 45px height  
- **Mobile** (<768px): Logo should be 40px height

### Step 4: Build for Production (After Testing)
Once you're happy with how it looks:
```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend
npm run build
```

## 🎨 Logo Specifications

The logo has been styled with:
- Drop shadow for visual depth
- Smooth scale animation on hover (1.05x)
- Automatic width to maintain circular aspect ratio
- Proper alt text for SEO and accessibility

## 🔧 Customization Options

If you want to adjust the logo size, edit `/Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`:

```tsx
const LogoImage = styled.img`
  height: 60px;  // Change this for desktop size
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    height: 45px;  // Change this for tablet size
  }

  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    height: 40px;  // Change this for mobile size
  }
`
```

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The logo automatically adjusts for mobile devices to ensure:
- Fast loading (responsive sizing)
- Good visibility (appropriate size)
- Maintains brand recognition
- Doesn't overwhelm small screens

## 🎨 Optional: Update Favicon

Your logo would make a great favicon too! To replace the current favicon:

1. Resize your logo to 256x256px (or smaller sizes: 128, 64, 32, 16)
2. Save as PNG files in `/frontend/public/`:
   - `favicon-256x256.png`
   - `favicon-128x128.png`
   - `favicon-64x64.png`
   - `favicon-32x32.png`
   - `favicon-16x16.png`
3. Optional: Convert to `.ico` format for `favicon.ico`

This will give users a consistent brand experience in browser tabs!

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy?

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You specifically asked NOT to deploy to production yet - test thoroughly in dev first!

When ready to deploy:
```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting
./deploy-frontend-vercel.sh
```

## 🎯 What to Test

Before deploying, verify:
- ✅ Logo loads quickly (check Network tab in DevTools)
- ✅ Logo looks crisp on retina/high-DPI displays
- ✅ Logo doesn't cause layout shift (CLS)
- ✅ Logo is accessible (has proper alt text)
- ✅ Logo scales properly on all devices
- ✅ Header and footer logos both display correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Logo not showing?**
- Check the file is at `/frontend/public/logo.png`
- Verify file permissions: `chmod 644 frontend/public/logo.png`
- Clear browser cache: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Check browser console for 404 errors

**Logo too big/small?**
- Edit the `height` values in Header.tsx or Footer.tsx
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

**Logo blurry?**
- Use a higher resolution image (at least 300x300px for circular logo)
- Save as PNG with transparency for best quality

**Need help?** If the logo doesn't look quite right, we can adjust:
- Size (height values)
