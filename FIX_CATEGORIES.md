# Fix Missing Categories Issue

## Problem
The categories API is cached and not showing "Holidays" and "Sports" categories, even though paintings exist with those categories.

## Solution

### Step 1: Restart Backend (REQUIRED)
The Spring Boot backend caches categories. Restart it to clear the cache:

```bash
# Find and kill the Java process
ps aux | grep -i "java.*painting" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill

# Wait 2 seconds
sleep 2

# Start backend again
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/backend
bash start-backend.sh
```

Wait about 30-60 seconds for backend to fully start.

### Step 2: Verify Categories
Once backend is running:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/paintings/categories" | jq '.'
```

You should now see:
```json
[
  "Animals",
  "Characters",
  "Fantasy",
  "Holidays",    ← Should appear now!
  "Nature",
  "Sports",      ← Should appear now!
  "Vehicles"
]
```

### Step 3: Refresh Your Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:3000/categories**

Press **Cmd + Shift + R** (hard refresh)

You should now see ALL 7 categories including **Holidays** and **Sports**!

## Bonus: Update Mandalas to Correct Category

The mandala paintings are currently in "Animals" category. To fix:

```bash
cd /Users/guym/Documents/d/paiting/tools

# Update all mandala paintings
cat all_new_paintings.json | jq -c '.[] | select(.key | contains("mandala"))' | while read painting; do
  URL_KEY=$(echo "$painting" | jq -r '.key')
  PAINTING_DATA=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/paintings/$URL_KEY")
  ID=$(echo "$PAINTING_DATA" | jq -r '.id')
  
  if [ "$ID" != "null" ]; then
    echo "Updating $URL_KEY to Mandalas category..."
    curl -s -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/paintings/$ID" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "$(echo "$PAINTING_DATA" | jq '. + {category: "Mandalas"}')" > /dev/null && echo "  ✅"
  fi
done
```

Then restart backend again to refresh category cache.

## Quick Test

After restarting backend, test these URLs:

### Category Pages:
- http://localhost:3000/category/Holidays
- http://localhost:3000/category/Sports
- http://localhost:3000/category/Mandalas (after fixing)

### Categories Overview:
- http://localhost:3000/categories

### Individual Paintings:
- http://localhost:3000/painting/santa-claus
- http://localhost:3000/painting/christmas-tree
- http://localhost:3000/painting/surfer
- http://localhost:3000/painting/basketball-player

## Why This Happened

Spring Boot caches the categories list for performance. When you add new paintings with new categories, the cache needs to be cleared. This is normal behavior - you just need to restart the backend after adding paintings with new categories.

In production, the cache automatically expires after 30 minutes, but during development, restarting is faster.
