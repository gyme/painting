## 🚀 How to Apply These Changes

### Option 1: Local Database (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# Make sure backend is running
cd backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# Go back to root and run the script
cd ..
./add-italian-brainrot.sh
```

### Option 2: Production Database (Railway)

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway run psql < backend/add-italian-brainrot.sql

# Or connect directly
railway connect
# Then paste the SQL content
```

### Option 3: Manual Database Update

1. Copy the contents of `backend/add-italian-brainrot.sql`
2. Open your database console (Railway dashboard or pgAdmin)
3. Paste and execute the SQL

## 🔍 Verify It Worked

After running the script, you should see:

```sql
-- Run this query to verify
SELECT id, url_key, title, title_es, category, featured 
FROM paintings 
WHERE category = 'Italian Brainrot' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

You should see 8 rows returned!

The category dropdown will now include:
