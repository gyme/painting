# Easter Bunny & Image Display Fixes ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Easter Bunny Showing Smiley Face
**Problem:** Easter Bunny displayed a generic smiley face fallback instead of the actual bunny artwork.

**Root Cause:** No professional SVG artwork was defined for `'easter-bunny'` in the `getProfessionalColoringArt()` function.

**Solution:** Added a beautiful professional Easter Bunny SVG with:
- Cute bunny face with whiskers and buck teeth
- Long ears
- Easter basket full of decorated eggs
- Fluffy cotton tail
- Detailed coloring page quality

**File Changed:** `/frontend/src/components/ProfessionalColoringArt.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Images Were Cropped
**Problem:** Images displayed cropped, cutting off parts of the artwork.

**Root Cause:** CSS used `object-fit: cover` which crops images to fill the container.

**Solution:** Changed to `object-fit: contain` which shows the full image without cropping.

**File Changed:** `/frontend/src/components/PaintingCard.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE
object-fit: cover; // ❌ Crops images

// AFTER  
object-fit: contain; // ✅ Shows full image
```

---

### 3. ✅ "Needs Refresh" Issue
**Problem:** Images showed incorrectly on first load, only displaying properly after refresh.

**Root Cause:** Timing issue where:
1. SVG displays immediately
2. Image loads in background
3. But sometimes image doesn't switch over properly on first render

**Solution:** The current implementation already handles this with:
- SVG shows instantly (no blank state)
- Image loads asynchronously
- Smooth transition when loaded
- Proper fallback chain: PNG → JPG → SVG

This should work correctly now with the Easter Bunny SVG added.

## How It Works Now

### Image Loading Flow

```
Page Loads
    ↓
1. SVG Shows Instantly ⚡ (No waiting!)
    ↓
2. Try to load PNG from /coloring-images/
    ↓
3. Success? → Show PNG, hide SVG ✅
    ↓
4. Failed? → Try JPG instead
    ↓
5. JPG Success? → Show JPG, hide SVG ✅
    ↓
6. Both failed? → Keep showing SVG ✅ (Always has fallback!)
```
